##CONTRIBUTING.md

####Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local workspace. <br/> <br/>
2. Make your own branch and work on your branch.

####Coding Style
####Commits and Pull Requests
Keep the commit log as healthy as the code. It is one of the first places new contributors will look at the project. <br/>

1. No more than one change per commit. There should be no changes in a commit which are unrelated to its message. <br/>
2. Keep the diffs as clean as possible. Avoid unnecessary line changes. <br/>

When filing a Pull Request, make sure it is rebased on top of most recent master. <br/>
